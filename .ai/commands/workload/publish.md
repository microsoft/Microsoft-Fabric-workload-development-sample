# Publish Workload to Fabric - Comprehensive Guide

## Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for AI tools on how to publish a Microsoft Fabric workload to the Fabric Workload Hub. Publishing is a manual process that involves uploading manifest packages through the Fabric Admin Portal and follows a structured workflow from testing to general availability.

Based on the official Microsoft documentation: [Publish a workload to the Fabric Workload Hub](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/workload-development-kit/publish-workload-flow)

### Publishing Architecture

The Fabric Workload Hub is where users browse, explore, and manage workloads within Fabric. Workloads are categorized into:
- **Core Fabric workloads**: Microsoft-developed workloads
- **Partner workloads**: Third-party developed workloads

### Publishing Stages

Publishing follows a structured four-stage process:

1. **Testing** - Internal validation and testing
2. **Preview Audience** - Limited tenant testing (up to 10 tenants)
3. **Preview** - Public preview for all Fabric users
4. **General Availability** - Full production release

## Prerequisites

### Administrative Requirements
- **Fabric Admin Account**: Account with admin permissions in the target tenant
- **Publishing Tenant**: Production Fabric tenant for workload lifecycle management
- **Workload Registration**: Completed registration form with Microsoft

### Technical Requirements
- **NuGet Package**: Built manifest package (.nupkg file)
- **Workload ID**: Registered unique identifier in format `[Publisher].[Workload]`
- **Production Configuration**: Workload configured for production environment
- **Testing Complete**: Workload validated in development environment

### Registration Requirements
Before publishing outside your organization, you must:
1. **Complete Workload Registration Form**: [Submit form](https://aka.ms/fabric_workload_registration)
2. **Define Publisher Name**: Meaningful company name or abbreviation
3. **Define Workload Name**: Align with product name or offering
4. **Await Microsoft Approval**: Fabric team enables publishing capability

## Stage 1: Testing

### Internal Testing Process

Testing is the initial stage where you validate your workload internally before exposing it to external users.

#### 1.1: Prepare Production Manifest

Ensure your workload manifest uses the registered Workload ID:

```xml
<!-- WorkloadManifest.xml -->
<Workload WorkloadName="YourPublisher.YourWorkload" HostingType="FERemote">
    <Version>1.0.0</Version>
    <!-- Additional configuration -->
</Workload>
```

#### 1.2: Build Production Package

Use the build script to create the manifest package:

```powershell
.\scripts\Build\BuildManifestPackage.ps1 -ValidateFiles $true
```

**Verify Package Contents:**
- Workload manifest with correct ID
- Item definitions properly configured  
- All required assets included
- Version information accurate

#### 1.3: Upload to Test Tenant

1. **Access Fabric Admin Portal**:
