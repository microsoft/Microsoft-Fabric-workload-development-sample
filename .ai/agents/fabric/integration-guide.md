# Fabric AI Agent Integration Guide

## Purpose

This document explains how to integrate and activate the Fabric AI Agent within the Microsoft Fabric Workload Development Kit project structure.

## Agent Configuration Summary

### Core Components

1. **Agent Config** (`agent-config.md`)
   - Main agent behavior and capabilities definition
   - Knowledge source integration strategy
   - Response guidelines and quality standards

2. **Knowledge Base** (`knowledge/`)
   - Specialized knowledge files for domain expertise
   - WDK development patterns and best practices
   - Platform-specific implementation guidance

3. **Prompt System** (`prompts/`)
   - System prompts for consistent behavior
   - Task-specific prompt templates
   - Response format and validation guidelines

4. **Capabilities** (`capabilities/`)
   - Tool integration specifications
   - Capability matrix and implementation levels
   - Quality assurance and validation frameworks

### Context Integration

The agent leverages these key context sources:

```yaml
Context Sources:
  Public Knowledge:
    - Microsoft Fabric platform documentation
    - Official APIs and specifications
    - Best practices and patterns
    - Community knowledge and examples

  Project Context:
    - .ai/context/fabric.md           # Platform overview
    - .ai/context/fabric_workload.md  # WDK guidance
    - Workload/app/                   # Implementation patterns
    - config/Manifest/                # Configuration examples
    - scripts/                        # Automation patterns
```

## Activation Instructions

### For AI Tools and Platforms

To activate the Fabric AI Agent:

1. **Load Context Files**
   ```
   Primary Context: .ai/context/fabric.md
   Secondary Context: .ai/context/fabric_workload.md
   Agent Config: .ai/agents/fabric/agent-config.md
   System Prompt: .ai/agents/fabric/prompts/system-prompt.md
   ```

2. **Apply Knowledge Integration**
   - Combine public Fabric knowledge with project-specific context
   - Prioritize official Microsoft documentation and patterns
   - Validate recommendations against project structure

3. **Enforce Quality Standards**
   - Verify technical accuracy against authoritative sources
   - Ensure security and compliance considerations
   - Provide actionable, implementation-ready guidance

### For Development Teams

To leverage the Fabric AI Agent:

1. **Ask Specific Questions**
   ```
   ✅ Good: "How do I implement OAuth scope selection in my ItemClient?"
   ❌ Vague: "Help me with authentication"
   ```

2. **Provide Context**
   ```
   ✅ Good: "I'm working on the PreConfigInstaller item and need to..."
   ❌ Limited: "I need help with my code"
   ```

3. **Request Implementation Details**
   ```
   ✅ Good: "Show me the exact TypeScript code for..."
   ❌ Abstract: "What are the best practices for..."
   ```

## Agent Capabilities Matrix

| Domain | Public Knowledge | Project Context | Implementation |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Workload Development** | ✅ Platform APIs | ✅ WDK Patterns | ✅ Code Generation |
| **Authentication** | ✅ Entra ID Docs | ✅ Client Examples | ✅ Implementation |
| **Data Integration** | ✅ OneLake Specs | ✅ Project Patterns | ✅ Code Examples |
| **UI Development** | ✅ Fluent UI Docs | ✅ Component Patterns | ✅ React Code |
| **Security** | ✅ Best Practices | ✅ Project Config | ✅ Implementation |
| **Deployment** | ✅ Azure Guidance | ✅ Script Patterns | ✅ Automation |

## Quality Assurance

### Response Validation

Every agent response should include:

1. **Technical Accuracy**: Verified against Microsoft documentation
2. **Project Relevance**: Tailored to current project structure
3. **Security Compliance**: Includes security and governance considerations
4. **Implementation Ready**: Provides concrete, actionable guidance
5. **Best Practices**: Follows Microsoft-approved patterns

### Continuous Improvement

The agent system includes mechanisms for:

- **Knowledge Updates**: Regular sync with platform updates
- **Pattern Validation**: Proven patterns from project success
- **Community Integration**: Incorporation of validated community practices
- **Feedback Integration**: User feedback and accuracy improvements

## Usage Examples

### Workload Development Query
```
User: "I need to create a new item type for document processing"

Agent Response:
1. Analyzes WDK patterns from project context
2. Provides four-component structure (Model, Editor, Empty, Ribbon)
3. Shows exact TypeScript interfaces and React components
4. Includes manifest configuration examples
5. Covers routing and authentication integration
6. Provides testing and validation guidance
```

### Integration Question
```
User: "How do I integrate with Power BI embedded analytics?"

Agent Response:
1. References official Power BI embedding documentation
2. Shows integration patterns from project structure
3. Provides authentication configuration examples
4. Includes security and compliance considerations
5. Demonstrates actual implementation code
6. Covers testing and validation approaches
```

## Maintenance and Updates

### Regular Maintenance Tasks

1. **Knowledge Synchronization**
   - Update context files with new platform features
   - Validate examples against current APIs
   - Incorporate new best practices

2. **Pattern Validation**
   - Test recommended patterns in actual implementations
   - Update based on proven project successes
   - Remove outdated or deprecated approaches

3. **Quality Monitoring**
   - Track response accuracy and relevance
   - Monitor user feedback and satisfaction
   - Identify knowledge gaps and improvement opportunities

### Update Triggers

Update the agent configuration when:
- Microsoft Fabric platform releases new features
- Project patterns are validated and proven
- Security or compliance requirements change
- Community identifies better practices or patterns

This integration guide ensures the Fabric AI Agent provides maximum value while maintaining accuracy, security, and implementation readiness for all Microsoft Fabric development scenarios.
