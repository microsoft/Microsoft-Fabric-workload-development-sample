# Fabric AI Agent

## Overview

The **Fabric AI Agent** is a specialized AI assistant designed to provide comprehensive support for Microsoft Fabric platform development, administration, and usage. This agent integrates public knowledge about Microsoft Fabric with project-specific context to deliver accurate, contextual assistance.

## How It Works

### Knowledge Integration

The agent combines multiple knowledge sources:

1. **Public Knowledge**: Comprehensive understanding of Microsoft Fabric platform
   - Platform architecture and components
   - Service capabilities and limitations
   - Best practices and patterns
   - Official documentation and specifications

2. **Project Context**: Local repository context files
   - **`.ai/context/fabric.md`** - Platform overview and capabilities
   - **`.ai/context/fabric_workload.md`** - WDK development guidance
   - **`Workload/`** - Current implementation patterns
   - **`config/Manifest/`** - Configuration examples

### Response Generation

The agent follows this process:

1. **Context Analysis**: Understand the user's question and required context
2. **Knowledge Synthesis**: Combine relevant public knowledge with project specifics
3. **Best Practice Application**: Apply Microsoft-approved patterns and security practices
4. **Actionable Guidance**: Provide concrete, implementable recommendations
5. **Validation**: Cross-reference against official sources and project constraints
