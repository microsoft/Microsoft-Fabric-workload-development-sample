## Introduction

### What is Fabric

Microsoft Fabric is a comprehensive analytics solution designed for enterprise-level applications. This platform encompasses a wide range of services, including data engineering, real-time analytics, and business intelligence, all consolidated within a single, unified framework.

The key advantage of Microsoft Fabric is its integrated approach, that eliminates the need for distinct services from multiple vendors. Users can leverage this platform to streamline their analytics processes, with all services accessible from a single source of truth.

Microsoft Fabric provides integration and simplicity, as well as a transparent and flexible cost management experience. This cost management experience allows users to control expenses effectively by ensuring they only pay for the resources they require.

The Fabric platform is not just a tool, but a strategic asset that simplifies and enhances the analytics capabilities of any enterprise.
More information about Fabric can be found in the [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/get-started/microsoft-fabric-overview).

### What Are Workloads

In Microsoft Fabric, workloads signify different components that are integrated into the Fabric framework. Workloads enhance the usability of your service within the familiar Fabric workspace, eliminating the need to leave the Fabric environment for different services. [Data Factory](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-factory/data-factory-overview), [Data Warehouse](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-warehouse/data-warehousing), [Power BI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/enterprise/service-premium-what-is) and [Fabric Activator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/real-time-intelligence/data-activator/activator-introduction) are some of the built-in Fabric workloads.

### What is the Workload Development Kit

With the Workload Development Kit, you can create your own workload for your data applications. Publishing a Fabric Workload to the [Fabric Workload Hub](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/workload-development-kit/more-workloads-add) increases your application’s discoverability and user engagement. The Microsoft Fabric Workload Development Kit provides the necessary tools and interfaces to embed your data application into Microsoft Fabric.

For more information on what workloads can offer Microsoft partners, and for useful examples, head to our official [Workload Dev Kit documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/workload-development-kit/development-kit-overview).

You can also learn more about the new [Fabric workload architecture](./docs/WDKv2-Introduction.md).

## Build Your Own Workload

### Get Started

#### Prerequisits

To run the development enviroment locally you need the follwoing components:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* [Powershell 7](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell)
* [Dotnet](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) for MacOS please make sure to install the x64 version 
* [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) or simmilar development enviroment
* [Fabric Tenant](https://app.fabric.microsoft.com/) that you use for development and publishing the Workload later on
* [Fabric Workspace](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/fundamentals/workspaces) that you can use to build your workload
* [Fabric Capacity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/enterprise/licenses) that is assigned to the workspace you are planning to use
* [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest) (only used for Entra App creation)
* [Entra App](https://entra.microsoft.com/) You either need an existing Entra App you can use that is [configured](./docs/WDKv2-How-To.md) corectly or you need permission to create a new Entra App.

#### Setting things up

To set things up follow the [WDKv2 Setup Guide](./docs/WDKv2-Setup.md).

### Start coding

After you have completed the initial steps you are all set to start adopting the Workload semple to your needs.

Be sure to look at what has been released with the [newest version of the WDK](./docs/WDKv2-Introduction.md) and our guide on [how to use those new features](./docs/WDKv2-How-To.md).

### Publish your workload

After developing your Fabric Workload according to the [certification requirements](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/workload-development-kit/publish-workload-requirements), you can publish it to the Workload Hub which will allow every Fabric user a chance to easily start a trial experience and then buy your workload. Use the  in-depth description of [how to publish a workload](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/workload-development-kit/publish-workload-flow) for the different stages and concepts provided by the platform.
