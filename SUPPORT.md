# Support

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome! Thanks for reaching out. Please note:

- **We no longer provide support by email.**  
  All questions and requests must be opened as GitHub issues.  
- **Use the Support Request template** when opening a new issue.  
  This helps us respond faster and keeps all ISV questions searchable.  
- **Response time:** We aim to respond within 2 business days (best effort).  
- **Before opening an issue:**  
  - Check existing issues (open and closed) to avoid duplicates.  
  - Review our documentation and FAQs.
