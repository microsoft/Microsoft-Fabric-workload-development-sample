We have introduced numerous updates and capabilities, in the latest update, including breaking changes which will require updating existing workloads, please see the list below:

## April 2024
- Devgateway - New control handlers, replacing SDK see [Backend readme](/Backend/README.md)

- Workload package - Updated the workload nuget package to support both the existing devmode and the new cloudmode.
